Welcome to Docker-Crud documentation!
===================================

**Docker** is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/guides/docker-overview/>`_ enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production. 

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project, an explanation on the docker compose file on :red:`explainingYAML` and additional :ref:`additionalconf` for DNS.

.. note::

   This project was made for DevOps class on UTFPR (Universidade Tecnológica Federal do Paraná), the documentation follows professor Hermano Pereira's teachings in containarizing a crud application with a WEB container in docker, as well as a DB container.
